# voc-w4-todo-list
Creating a to-do list application using JavaScript involves combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. The HTML sets up the basic structure of the application, including an input field where users can type new tasks, a button to add these tasks, and an unordered list to display the tasks. CSS is used to style the application, making it visually appealing and easy to use by defining the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. Finally, JavaScript brings interactivity to the application. It handles user actions such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and removing tasks from the list. JavaScript functions manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the list in real-time based on user input. This project demonstrates how to create a responsive and interactive to-do list by effectively utilizing these web development technologies.
